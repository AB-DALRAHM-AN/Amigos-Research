        <h4>the inflation is a big problem it face any country and the country try to avoid it</h4>
        <h4>inflation is increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy</h4>

        <h4>when the general price level rice the power of buying goods and services decrease so it effect negative to
          the economy of the country so we learn from the old experience to avoid this negative effect </h4>
        <h4>the inflation is calculated by the consumer price index (CPI) which measures the percentage change in the
          price of a basket of goods and services consumed by households</h4>
