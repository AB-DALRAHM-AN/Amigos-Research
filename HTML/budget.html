        <h2>budget deficet?</h2>
        <h4>“Budget deficit” happens when government`s expenditure exceeds it`s revenue.
          Government can run through budget deficit for many reasons, such as funding public projects or programs,
          responding to emergencies or stimulating economic growth.
          However, if a government run through budget deficit many times this can lead to accumulation of public debt.
        </h4>
        <h2>Budget deficit from (2001 till 2021)</h2>
        <h4>There were common reasons for Egypt`s budget deficit in the timeline from
          (2001 till 2021)
        </h4>
        <h3>public sector wages: </h3>
        <h4>the government had a large public sector workforce and paid high wages, which contributed in its spending
        </h4>
        <h3>Subsidies: </h3>
        <h4>Egypt had a system of subsidies for various goods and services,
          Which placed a burden on government`s finance
        </h4>
        <h3>Structursl issues: </h3>
        <h4>Egypt had many structural issues, such as large informal sector and limited amount of taxes collection which
          made it difficult to balance the budget.</h4>
        <h3>High levels of debt and debt servicing: </h3>
        <h4>Egypt had very high levels of debt which kept to increase over the years</h4>
        <h4>There were also some specific reasons in some years for budget deficit example in 2003, (the Iraq war) which
          caused decline in tourism, which we can notice that the tourism represent very important part in the GDP of
          Egypt.</h4>
        <h4>In 2005, there were also decline in tourism due to terrorist attacks on Sharm El-Sheikh, which resulted in a
          reduction in revenue.</h4>
        <h4>In 2008, the global financial crisis took place it had a negative impact on Egypt`s economy, resulting
          decline in exports and a reduction in revenue, the impact of the Global financial crisis remained from 2008
          till 2010 but it wasn`t fully recovered from.</h4>
        <h4>In 2010, there were many reasons for the public deficit occurrence but mainly because of the political
          instability which caused a negative impact on the government revenue.</h4>
        <h4>In 2011, the revolution of 2011 took place where it lasted for several months the protesters demanded the
          ousting of the president hosni Mubarak which made the government to take an action which was spending a lot of
          money on security, the tourism declined because of the instability and political issues in Egypt.</h4>

        <h4>In 2017, the impact of devaluation still remained and later and the government spending on security dur to
          political issues.</h4>
        <h4>In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic took place which led negative impact on Egypt because government spend high
          amount of money on healthcare and social welfare programs, the pandemic also led to a decrease in tourism
          revenues, which is a critical source of foreign currency for Egypt.</h4>
        <h2>GOVERNMENT`S EFFORT</h2>
        <h3>1. Reducing subsidies: Subsidies on fuel and electricity were a major drain on the government's budget, as
          they were heavily subsidized to keep prices low for consumers. However, these subsidies were also expensive,
          and the government has reduced them in recent years to free up funds for other programs. To ensure that the
          poor are not adversely affected by these changes, the government has redirected the savings towards social
          safety net programs that provide targeted support to those in need.</h3>
        <h3>2. Tax reforms: Tax reforms are aimed at increasing government revenue by collecting taxes from individuals
          and businesses. The introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) is a key example of a tax reform measure, which is
          a tax on the value added at each stage of production and distribution. Raising customs tariffs and increasing
          taxes on high-income individuals are other examples of measures aimed at increasing revenue.</h3>
        <h3>3. Cutting spending: Austerity measures involve reducing government spending in various areas to help
          balance the budget. These measures can include reducing public sector wages, travel expenses, and
          non-essential purchases. While these measures can be unpopular, they are often necessary to help control
          government spending and reduce the budget deficit.</h3>
        <h3>4. Attracting foreign investment: Attracting foreign investment can help to stimulate economic growth and
          create jobs. The government can take steps to improve the investment climate in the country, such as
          streamlining regulations and offering incentives to foreign investors, to make it more attractive for
          businesses to invest in Egypt.</h3>
        <h3>5. Borrowing: Borrowing is one way for the government to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditures.
          The government can borrow from international lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, to access funds
          that can be used to finance government operations and programs. However, borrowing also comes with costs, such
          as interest payments, and can lead to higher levels of debt if not managed properly.</h3>
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <h4>Despite the crisis that faced the Egyptian economy from the Iraq war till the COVID-19 pandemic but Egypt
          also overcame many of these crisis not on a huge scale but a very good performance for example from 2006 the
          budget deficit was
          (-7.00%) later in 2007 it managed to decrease it to be (-6.50%) and in 2017 the budget deficit was (-10.90%)
          later in 2018 it managed to decrease to be (-8.20%).
