        <h4>The Balance of Payments is a very important economic indicator that reflects the international economic
          transactions of a country. In the case of Egypt, the balance of payments has been a critical indicator of the
          country's economic growth and stability. We can find in this article the balance of payments in Egypt from
          2001
          to 2021, and highlight the main trends and changes that occurred throughout this period.</h4>

        <h2>Balance of Payments Overview</h2>

        <h4>The Balance of Payments is a record of a country's international transactions, including imports, exports,
          investments, and transfers. It is divided into two main components:</h4>
        <h3>
          1- The current account.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          2- The capital account.
        </h3>
        <h4>The current account includes transactions related to trade in goods and services, income and transfers,The
          capital account includes transactions related to capital transfers and investments.</h4>

        <h3>Egypt's balance of payments from 2001 to 2021:</h3>
        <h2>before the revolution:</h2>
        <h4>Egypt's balance of payments has witnessed significant changes over the past two decades.
          In 2001, Egypt had a current account deficit of $1.6 billion and a capital account surplus of $5.5 billion.
          This was due to the high level of foreign investment in the country at that time.

          However, by 2011, when the January 25 revolution took place, Egypt's current account deficit increased to
          $11.2 billion, while the capital account surplus decreased to $1.5 billion.
          This is due to the decrease in foreign investment and the increase in imports.</h4>
        <h2>after the revolution:</h2>
        <h4>The years following the 2011 revolution were particularly challenging for Egypt's balance of payments,
          The country witnessed a significant drop in foreign investment, while the tourism sector, an important source
          of foreign exchange, was hit hard. As a result, Egypt's current account deficit widened to $18.8 billion in
          2013.
          <h4>To address this problem, the government
            introduced a number of economic reforms, including:</h4>

          <h3>
            - the devaluation of the Egyptian pound
          </h3>
          <h3>
            - reduced energy support
          </h3>
          <h4>
            Introducing the value added tax on most products and commodities.
            The economic reforms implemented by the government helped improve Egypt's balance of payments.
            By 2018, the current account deficit had decreased to $6.8 billion, while the capital account surplus had
            increased to $9.1 billion.
            This was due to a combination of factors, including:
          </h4>
          <h3>
            -Tourism recovery
          </h3>

          <h3>
            - And increase foreign investment.
          </h3>

          In 2020 and like all countries of the world, Egypt's balance of payments has been affected by the COVID-19
          pandemic.
          <h3>
            The state saw:
          </h3>
          <h4>
            A drop in tourism and a drop in exports, leading to a widening current account deficit.

            However, the government's efforts to attract foreign investment and implement economic reforms have helped
            mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the country's balance of payments.
          </h4>

          <h2>to summary all of this:</h2>
          <h4>Egypt's balance of payments has witnessed significant changes over the past two decades. The country has
            experienced both surpluses and deficits, depending on a combination of factors, including foreign
            investment,
            tourism, and the global economic environment.

            improve Egypt's balance of payments.
          </h4>
          <h4> However, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed new challenges to the country's
            economic stability, highlighting the need for continued efforts to strengthen the balance of payments.</h4>
