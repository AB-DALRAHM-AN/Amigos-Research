      <h1>A BRIEF BACKGROUND ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT IN EGYPT FOR THE PAST</h1>
      <li>
        <h3>FIVE YEARS (2015 : 2019): (Source: The Egyptian Central Agency for Public Mobilization And Statistics
          Report)</h3>
        <h4>During the past five years, unemployment rates in Egypt showed a graduate decrease. The
          unemployment rate rose to a maximum of 12.9 in Q3-FY15 and reached a minimum of 7.5%
          in Q2-FY19. The labor force reached 29.5 millions in Q3-FY17 and decrease slitlly to 29.2
          millions in Q3-FY18 but showed a big decrease by 4% in Q4-FY18 to 28 millions. The labor
          force showed graduate increase since then, and reached 29 millions in Q4-FY19.
          The lower unemployment rate is a result of Egypt initiated aggressive reforms that included
          liberalization of the Egyptian pound, elimination of most subsidies and the introduction of
          new taxes.</h4>
        <h4>The decreasing of unemployment rates came after national megaprojects, which included the
          construction of new cities, thousands of kilometers of roads, electricity plants and bridges.
          The construction sector employs 14.1% of the Egyptian workforce. Other sectors are also
          demanding additional labor.</h4>
        <h4>The reclaiming of tens of thousands of hectares of land to use in agriculture helped decreasing
          the rate of unemployment, as agriculture sector saw an increase in its workforce. Gigantic fish
          farms in the Nile Delta and near the Suez Canal have also provided employment opportunities.
          The limitations applied by the Egyptian government toward imported products led to
          increasing local production, which is causing industrial projects to hire more workers.</h4>

        <h2>UNEMPLOYMENT DESCRIPTION: (Source: The Egyptian Central Agency for Public Mobilization And Statistics
          Report)</h2>
        <h4>The debate on employment and unemployment in Egypt has been a major feature of public
          policy for the last few years. With unemployment reaching double-digit figures, the social
          actors have realized that it is time to confront the problem
          The main type of unemployment in Egypt is structural, not cyclical, and it affects a very
          specific group of people young, educated, new labor market entrants – and includes very
          few people who have been employed and have lost their jobs. The unemployed are mostly
          people looking for formal work for the first time, and unemployment rises when a large
          number of educated new entrants are trying to enter the labor market. However, this was not
          the case in 2012, when the number of young people entering the labor market actually declined
          due to demographic changes, but it was taking longer for people to leave the unemployment
          queue (Source: Assad and Kraft, 2013a) The youth unemployment rate is higher than the total unemployment rate,
          standing at 19% for
          15-24-year-olds and 16% for 15-29-year-olds in 2012. However, there is a big difference
          between the rates for young males and young females: while young males aged 15-24 have a
          reasonable rate of 10%, young females suffer from a 50% unemployment rate.</h4>
        <h4>decreases slightly when we consider the higher age range of 15-29, but the fact that it is
          primarily females who suffer from unemployment is the same. This implies serious labor
          market barriers and gender discrimination against women in Egypt, even despite the fact that the majority of
          women are inactive.</h4>

        <h2>TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN EGYPT: (Source: The Egyptian Central Agency for Public Mobilization And Statistics
          Report)</h2>
        <h3>Natural Unemployment </h3>
        <h4>Natural unemployment consists of two of the three main types of unemployment: frictional
          and structural. It explains why there will always be some level of unemployment, even in
          a healthy economy. People will always be changing jobs, and sometimes they leave a job
          before finding a new one. There will always be some people with skills that are no longer
          needed. </h4>
        <h4>This unemployment is an economic indicator that shows that the state economy is healthy
          and the normal rate of unemployment is usually about 4%.</h4>
        <h3>Structural Unemployment </h3>
        <h4>Structural unemployment occurs when there is a mismatch between the jobs that are
          available and the people looking for work.
          This mismatch could be because:
          I. jobseekers do not have the skills required to do the available jobs,
          II. The available jobs are a long way from the jobseekers.
          Structural unemployment tends to be longer lasting than other types of unemployment.
          This is because it can take a number of years for workers to develop new skills or move to
          a different region to find a job that matches their skills</h4>
        <h3>Cyclical Unemployment</h3>
        <h4>Economists say it is the worst kind type when natural business cycles bring about loss of
          jobs
          Cyclical unemployment is caused by the contraction phase of the business cycle. That's
          when the demand for goods and services falls dramatically. It forces businesses to lay off
          large numbers of workers to cut costs.
          Cyclical unemployment creates more unemployment. The laid-off workers have less
          money to buy the goods and services they need. That further lowers demand.</h4>
        <h2>UNEMPLOYMENT DEFINITIONS: (Source: The Egyptian Central Agency for Public Mobilization And Statistics
          Report)</h2>
        <h3>Definition 1:</h3>
        <h4>Unemployment occurs when a person who is actively searching for employment is
          unable to find work. Unemployment is often used as a measure of the health of the
          economy. The most frequent measure of unemployment is the unemployment rate,
          which is the number of unemployed people divided by the number of people in the labor
          force (How the Government Measures Unemployment, August 10, 2020.) </h4>
        <h3>Definition 2:</h3>
        <h4>Underemployment occurs when workers' jobs don't use all their skills, education, or
          availability to work. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
          Development, there are two types of underemployment: visible and invisible.
          i. Visible Underemployment
          Visible underemployment includes employees who are working fewer hours than
          is typical in their field. They are willing and able to work more hours but cannot
          get full-time employment. They often work two part-time jobs just to make ends
          meet.
          ii. Invisible Underemployment
          Invisible underemployment includes workers in full-time jobs that don't use
          all their skills. This type of underemployment is almost impossible to measure. It
          requires extensive surveying that compares workers' skills to job requirements.
          The workers often don't even realize their skills could be better used elsewhere.
          (OECD. "Glossary of Statistical Terms: Underemployment, 2020)</h4>
        <h3> Definition 3:</h3>
        <h4>The unemployed comprise all persons of working age who were: (a) without work during
          the reference period, i.e. we are not in paid employment or self-employment; (b) currently
          available for work, i.e. were available for paid employment or self-employment during
          the reference period; and (c) seeking work, i.e. had taken specific steps in a specified
          recent period to seek paid employment or self-employment. Future starters, that is,
          persons who did not look for work but have a future labor market stake (made
          arrangements for a future job start) are also counted as unemployed, as well as
          participants in skills training or retraining schemes within employment promotion
          programs, who on that basis, were “not in employment”, not “currently available” and
          did not “seek employment” because they had a job offer to start within a short
          subsequent period generally not greater than three months and persons “not in
          employment” who carried out activities to migrate abroad in order to work for pay or
          profit but who were still waiting for the opportunity to leave. In many national contexts
          there may be persons not currently in the labor market who want to work but do not
          actively “seek” work because they view job opportunities as limited, or because they
          have restricted labor mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural
          barriers. The exclusion of people who want to work but are not seeking work (in the
          past often called the “hidden unemployed” or the “unemployed according to the relaxed
          definition” which also included persons formerly known as “discouraged workers”) is
          a criterion that will affect the count of both women and men although women may have
          a higher probability of being excluded from the count of unemployed because they
          suffer more from social barriers overall that impede them from meeting this criterion.
          Another factor leading to exclusion from the unemployment count concerns the
          criterion that workers be available for work during a given (short) reference period. A
          short availability period tends to exclude those who would need to make personal
          arrangements before starting work, such as for care of children or elderly relatives or
          other household affairs, even if they are “available for work” soon after the short
          reference period. As women are often responsible for household affairs and care, they
          are a significant part of this group and would therefore not be included in measured
          unemployment. (International Conference of Labour Statisticians, October 2013)</h4>
        <h3>the egyption unemployment in egypt now 9.33%</h3>
        <h2>in conclution</h2>
        <h4>Unemployment is a serious matter in Egypt. Although its fundamental right
          for citizen to get job according to their qualification. However, there is not enough job for everyone so huge
          number of people without any job cause a lot of problems. The number of
          unemployed people is increasing day by day and situation is getting much worsen. Main
          reason for unemployment is overpopulation, undeveloped and rotten education system,
          corruption, government policy etc. so jobless people spend miserable life without money. So
          that affects Egyptian economy, culture, society hardly. Several solutions such as desert
          reclamation, constructing and reform textile sector, postpone privatization to company had
          done but nothing was much successful. So new solution such as Establish large number of
          mills, factories, industries and change in education system and youth motivation must needed
          in order to decrease rate of unemployment in Egypt.</h4>
