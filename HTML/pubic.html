      <h1>Public debt`s definition: -</h1>
      <li>
        <h4>Public debt refers to the amount of money that a government owes to its creditors, including individuals,
          institutions, and foreign governments. It is the total outstanding borrowing of a government, which has been
          accumulated over time through the issuance of bonds, notes, and other securities. Public debt is a common way
          for governments to finance their operations and investments, particularly during times of economic hardship or
          crisis. The size of a country's public debt is often used as an indicator of its economic stability and
          creditworthiness.</h4>

        <h2>Notice that Egypt has experienced a high amount of debt in the recent years that reaches to over 90% of the
          GDP ratio.</h2>

        <h3>Public debt from (2001 till 2021)</h3>
        <h4>There are common reasons between the years for the increase of the public debt:</h4>
        <h4>A1.Investment in infrastructure: the huge amount of investment in infrastructure over the years which
          increased the debt</h4>
        <h4>2.Economic challenges: the government faced many challenges including high unemployment, inflation rate and
          lack of foreign investment also the high amount of spending that the government made on public programs
          (social safety nets and subsidies).</h4>
        <h4>3.security concerns: the government had to increase spending in security and defense to deal with terrorism
          which added to its burden debt.</h4>
        <h4>4.External shocks: because of the 9/11 incident it had an impact on Egypt`s economy so, foreign investments
          decreased which later exacerbated the government need to borrow money.</h4>
        <h3>There were also specific highlights for the increase of the public debt in each year:-</h3>
        <h4>1.In 2001: Egypt's public debt decreased as a percentage of GDP, from 94.3% in 2000 to 88.6% in 2001, due to
          debt restructuring and a rise in GDP.</h4>
        <h4>2. 2002: Egypt's public debt increased due to continued investment in infrastructure projects, economic
          challenges, external shocks, and security concerns.</h4>
        <h4>3.2003: Egypt's public debt increased due to continued investment in infrastructure projects, economic
          challenges, external shocks, security concerns, and reforms/structural adjustments.</h4>
        <h4>4.2004-2009: Egypt's public debt continued to increase due to investment in infrastructure projects,
          economic challenges, external shocks, and security concerns. During this period, Egypt also implemented some
          economic reforms aimed at reducing its debt burden. specifically in 2008 the impact of the global financial
          crisis was very big not only in Egypt but on many other countries.</h4>
        <h4>5.2010-2011: Egypt's public debt continued to increase due to investment in infrastructure projects,
          economic challenges, and political instability (2011 revolution), including protests and a change in
          government.</h4>
        <h4>6.2012-2013: Egypt's public debt increased due to continued investment in infrastructure projects, economic
          challenges, political instability, and a decrease in foreign investment and revenues.</h4>
        <h4>7.2014-2016: Egypt's public debt continued to increase due to investment in infrastructure projects,
          economic challenges, political instability, and a decrease in foreign investment and revenues. In 2016, Egypt
          devalued its currency, which led to higher borrowing costs and increased its debt burden.</h4>
        <h4>8.2017-2019: Egypt's public debt continued to increase due to investment in infrastructure projects,
          economic challenges, and increased spending on healthcare and social programs. However, Egypt also implemented
          some economic reforms during this period aimed at reducing its debt burden.</h4>
        <h4>9.2020-2021: Egypt's public debt increased significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a
          decrease in revenues and increased spending on healthcare, social programs, and economic stimulus measures.
          The pandemic also led to a decrease in foreign investment and tourism revenues, which further exacerbated
          Egypt's debt burden.</h4>
        <h2>Government efforts to reduce public debt </h2>
        <h4>1-Economic reforms: The government has implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at reducing the debt
          burden and improving the country's economic outlook. These reforms include reducing fuel subsidies, increasing
          taxes, and privatizing state-owned enterprises. The government has also introduced a value-added tax and
          passed a new investment law to attract more foreign investment.</h4>
        <h4>2-Debt restructuring: Egypt has engaged in debt restructuring programs to lower its borrowing costs and
          reduce the overall debt burden. For example, in 2018, Egypt signed a debt-swap deal with Italy, where the
          Italian government agreed to restructure â‚¬95 million of Egypt's debt at lower interest rates.</h4>
        <h4>3-Increased tax collection: The government has taken steps to improve tax collection and reduce tax evasion,
          which has helped to increase revenue and reduce the need for borrowing. In 2019, the government launched a
          comprehensive tax reform program aimed at simplifying the tax system and increasing compliance.</h4>
        <h4>4-Targeted social programs: The government has implemented targeted social programs, such as cash transfers
          and food subsidies, to support the poorest segments of society. By reducing poverty and inequality, the
          government hopes to stimulate economic growth and reduce the need for borrowing.</h4>
        <h4>5-Foreign aid and investment: Egypt has received foreign aid and investment from various countries and
          international organizations, which has helped to finance some of its infrastructure projects and reduce its
          borrowing needs. In 2020, Egypt received a $5.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to support
          its economic recovery efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.</h4>
        <h2>Conclusion:-</h2>
        <h4>In conclusion, Egypt's public debt has increased significantly from 2001 to 2021. The main factors
          contributing to this increase include investment in infrastructure, economic challenges, security concerns,
          external shocks, and structural adjustments. Despite the government's efforts to reduce the debt burden
          through economic reforms, debt restructuring, increased tax collection, targeted social programs, and foreign
          aid and investment, Egypt's public debt remains high. As such, it is important for the government to continue
          pursuing prudent fiscal policies to ensure long-term sustainability and reduce the risk of a debt crisis.</h4>
