        <h4>The GDP measures the market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy within one year.
          This includes all commodities, even if the produced commodities belong to foreign companies, because they were
          produced within the countrys borders and with its resources.</h4>

        <h2> Well, let's see the Egyptian (GDP) 10 years before the revolution and 10 years after it</h2>

        <h3>BEFORE:</h3>
        <h4>As we can see before the revolution, the GDP was fluctuating from time to time, but when the revolution
          broke
          out in 2011, we saw a sudden drop in the GDP from 5.1% to 1.8% The country was exposed to it in those days,
          and
          it was expected that Egypt would declare bankruptcy, but with the help of God, the people understood the
          extent
          of the disaster and were able to gather their diaspora and face the devastation that took place.</h4>
        <h3>AFTER:</h3>
        <h4>After the outbreak of the revolution and its end, we saw that it was difficult to stand up again as we were
          before it, but we were able to stand up, and as we can see from the graph in 2012 and 2013, we were able to
          increase by a little bit and gradually, and we found ourselves regaining our economic strength again until
          2019
          and it was The disastrous year for the whole world due to the Covid 19 epidemic is the year 2020. The GDP has
          fallen again, a sudden drop from 5.6% to 3.6%, and this is what makes us suffer so far from the effects of
          that
          decline,( as if the number 5 billion was a number that we cannot break), and this is what we seek to restore.
          The glories of the year 2007, when the GDP was equal to 7.2%</h4>
